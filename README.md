## Maximo Librandi - Solution Description

### Approach:

For this assignment, I followed the approach described below:

- The Table shows the data fetched from the API handler (pages/api/data.ts) in a tabular format. 
- The columns being shown are: ID, Name, Email, Street, City, Zipcode, Phone, and Status.
- Each cell is colored based on the severity of the error according to the provided guidelines (critical: red, warning: yellow, no error: green).
- If there is an error in a cell, the error message is shown as a tooltip when hovering over the cell.
- Each row has also a button "Error Summary" which when clicked, shows a modal with the error summary for that row. The summary includes the attribute name, error message, and severity. The errors are sorted by severity and attribute name.
- There is a button "Export to CSV" which when clicked, downloads the data in CSV format.
- For the styling, I used the React Bootstrap library.

### Assumptions:

I made the following assumptions while working on this assignment:

- The API handler (pages/api/data.ts) returns the data in the format as shown in the provided MOCK_DATA.
- The severity of the error can be either "critical" or "warning".
- There could be multiple errors for one record in the data.
- The address is already provided in different columns (Street, City, Zipcode) and does not need to be combined.
- When exporting to CSV, the errors are stored as a JSON string.

### Next Steps:

If I had more time to work on this assignment, I would add the following improvements:

- Add pagination to the table to handle large datasets.
- Add search, sort, and filter functionality to the table.
- Improve the styling and make the UI more user-friendly.

### **Take-Home Assignment: Data Review, Editor, and Exporter**

**Objective**: Build a data review interface that queries JSON data from a Next.js API, displays the data in a table format with validation errors, and allows users to export the data in CSV format. You will also color-code validation errors and provide error details in an interactive way.

**Deliverables**:

1. **Data Query from API**: Implement a Next.js API route that returns the provided mock JSON data (attached below).
2. **Data Review Table**:
    - Display the data in a table, flattening any nested fields (e.g., `address`) into separate columns (e.g., `Street`, `City`, `Zipcode`).
    - Color-code validation errors in each column according to severity:
        - Red for critical errors (must be fixed).
        - Yellow for warnings (should be reviewed).
        - Green for valid fields.
    - **Hoverable Error Messages**: Each cell with a validation error should display the error message on hover as a tooltip.
    - **Error Summary Modal**: Include an "Error Summary" modal with a clickable button or link that opens a modal. This modal should list all the validation errors for that specific row, with details for each error.
3. **CSV Export**: Allow users to export the data to a CSV format.


**Design Considerations**:

- **No Figma Provided**: We have deliberately not provided Figma or design assets for this project. This is to give you the freedom to design the table and modals as you see fit. Part of the evaluation will be based on your ability to create a user-friendly, intuitive UI without strict design guidelines. You're free to choose the best layout, color schemes, and UX patterns, and UI Libraries that fit the task.


**Mock Data**: You will be working with the following mock JSON data. The data will always follow a static model. Your API should serve this data to the frontend:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "New York",
      "zipcode": "12345",
      "phone": "123-456-7890",
      "status": "active",
      "errors": {
        "phone": {
          "message": "Invalid phone format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Invalid zipcode",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@sample",
      "street": "456 Elm St",
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "zipcode": "",
      "phone": "987-654-3210",
      "status": "inactive",
      "errors": {
        "email": {
          "message": "Invalid email format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Zipcode is missing",
          "severity": "critical"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
      "street": "",
      "city": "Chicago",
      "zipcode": "60614",
      "phone": "111-222-3333",
      "status": "pending",
      "errors": {
        "street": {
          "message": "Street address is missing",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

**Expectations**:

- **Tech Stack**: Use **Next.js** for API and server-side rendering, React for frontend components. Styling can be done with **Tailwind CSS** or your **UI library of choice**.
- **Time Estimation**: This assignment should take 4â€“6 hours to complete.
- **Submission**: Please fork this repo, and provide a GitHub repo link containing your code, with a README explaining your approach, assumptions, and any improvements you would make given more time.
